#  Module 13 : E-commerce backend

## Overview

I have amended te backend of an ecommerce site to have working routes for different functionality in regards to the databse and the products, tags, and categories of products.

## Installation

It requires SWL, Node, and a CLI to work. Insomnia ot a similar app will be needed to test it.

## Usage

The application has a database, modeled tables, and seed data to test the funcitonality and realationships between tables. Routes are available to add, edit, and delete individual and batch categories, products, and tags.
